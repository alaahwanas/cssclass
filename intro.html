  <p>What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</p>

<h3>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h3>
<p>
  HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
  HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
  To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
  CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>
